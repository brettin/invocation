            <h2>Create your HTML page</h2>

            <p>An IRIS tutorial can live anywhere you want, it's just an HTML page which is well formatted in the following way:

            <div style = 'white-space : pre'>
                &lt;div id = '<i><b>tutorial</b></i>'&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;<i><b>This is the name of the tutorial</b></i>&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;div&gt;
                        <i><b>This is the summary of the tutorial and may contain any content/HTML you would like.</b></i>
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;!-- the next div tag contains all subsequent pages --&gt;
                    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h2&gt;<i><b>This is the name of the first step</b></i>&lt;/h2&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;
                                <i><b>This is the text of the step and may contain any content/HTML you would like. It does not have to be in a div tag.
                                Anything after the h2 is considered content.</b></i>
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h2&gt;<i><b>This is the name of the second step</b></i>&lt;/h2&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;
                                <i><b>This is the text of the step and may contain any content/HTML you would like.</b></i>
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h2&gt;<i><b>This is the name of the third step</b></i>&lt;/h2&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;
                                <i><b>This is the text of the step and may contain any content/HTML you would like.</b></i>
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;!-- and on and on as many times as necessary --&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            </div>

            <p>BE CAREFUL - please make all links, images, and other references FULLY QUALIFIED URLS. Relative links will not work when embedded into IRIS.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Upload your content somewhere.</h2>

            <p>Your page may be placed anywhere you want. Note the URL.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Register in IRIS</h2>

            <p>Contact the appropriate person to register your tutorial into IRIS. Currently, that'd be Jim Thomason (thomason@cshl.edu)</p>

            <p>Tell them the name to use when selecting the tutorial in IRIS, as well as the URL to pick up the content.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Sit back and relax.</h2>

            <p>You're done. Just kick back and wait for the changes to be deployed, with your new tutorial in place.</p>
