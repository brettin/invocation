    <li>Resolved an issue preventing tutorial loads</li>
</ul>
<h3>v0.0.6 - 12/13/2013</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Minor bug fixes.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Resolved the issue regarding downloads occasionally not working.</li>
        <li>Resolved the layout issue that would occasionally make the chevrons on the command list slide off the screen.</li>
        <li>Fixed redirecting STDERR, as well as appending to files.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>v0.0.5 - 11/18/2013</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Scriptability - save your commands to a file (one command per line), then run it later with <b>execute</b> <i>nameofscript</i></li>
    <li>Scriptability - Write a javascript program and run it later with <b>evaluate</b> <i>text of program</i> or
        <b>evaluate</b> <i>name of program file</i>. The terminal object is accessible via $terminal, the current widget
        via $widget. Run further iris commands via $terminal.invoke('....');
    </li>
    <li>Multiple commands can be run at once - delimited commands with semicolons. <b>echo a </b><u>;</u><b> echo b</b></li>
    <li><b>ls</b> command can now accept standard shell wildcard syntax <b>ls</b> <i>*.txt</i>, or <b>ls</b> <i>sequences.*</i>, etc.</li>
    <li>Added <b>variables</b> command to list user defined session variables</li>
    <li>Added <b>download</b> <i>filename</i> command to download a file from the command line</li>
    <li>Added <b>edit</b> <i>filename</i> command to launch the file editor from the command line</li>
    <li>Added <b>environment</b> and <b>setenv</b> <i>key=value</i> syntax to customize IRIS behavior</li>
    <li>Added <b>end</b> command to jump to end of terminal input</li>
    <li>Added <b>record</b> command. Save all your actions from that point on as an executable script. Save it with <b>save</b> <i>nameofscript</i>.
    It can then be executed with <b>execute</b> <i>nameofscript</i></li>
    <li>Added new file button (<i class = 'icon-file'></i>) to file browser to add and optionally immediately edit a file</li>
    <li>Added automatic communication with the workspace. Pass around "files" with <b>@W#<i>workpaceid:type:objectid-instance</i></b>,
    such as: <b>all_entities_Genome &gt; @W#genome_obj_in_workspace</b>, will create an object with id 'genome_obj_in_workspace
    in your current workspace. The workspace id, type, and instance number are optional (and must be : delimited, the instance is appended
    with a hyphen). If this is an ID through standard script redirects (&lt; or &gt;), you don't need to specify IO. If it's a switch
    (<b>some_script -i <i>name_of_file</i></b>) then append the io flag - @W#objid#i to read from the workspace or @W#objid#o to write to it.</li>
    <li>Much nicer selection of variables with the right arrow key</li>
    <li>Alphabetically sorted the groups of commands</li>
    <li>Scrolling up while the UI is automatically scrolling down will now halt the scroll</li>
    <li>Greatly improved performance of view command</li>
    <li>Moved the interface to bootstrap v3.0</li>
