This is not the place to characterize what is meant by "metabolic reconstruction", but as we use the term 
here we mean roughly <i>a set of <a href="http://www.theseed.org/wiki/Glossary#Subsystem" target=blank_>
subsystems</a> that are believed to be present in the genome, along with
the relevant variant codes</i>.
You can get a metabolic reconstruction for the annotated genome using a command like
<br>
<pre>
  genomeTO_to_reconstructionTO < annotated.genome > reconstruction
<br></pre>
Now, to see the roles that were found, use 
<br>
<pre>
  reconstructionTO_to_roles < reconstruction > roles
<br></pre>
To see the subsystems (along with the variant codes that seemed appropriate), use
<br>
<pre>
  reconstructionTO_to_subsystems < reconstruction > subsystems
<br></pre>
