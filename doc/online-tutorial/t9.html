Now, suppose that you wished to compare this set of Roles against the set found in
<i>Geobacter metallireducens GS-15</i> (<i>kb|g.9032</i> in the CS).  You can get the roles for
that genome using
<br>
<pre>
  echo 'kb|g.9032' | genomes_to_fids CDS | fids_to_roles 2> /dev/null | <br />  cut -f 3 > roles.in.g.9032
<br></pre>
Before you run it, note that the command <b>fids_to_roles</b> writes error messages when it cannot match
a fid to any Roles.
<p>
Now you can use
<br>
<pre>
  a_and_b roles.in.g.9032 all.roles > roles.for.models.g.9032
  a_not_b roles.for.models roles.for.models.g.9032 > roles.to.search.for
<br></pre>

to create a file of Roles in <i>kb|g.9032</i>, but not yet found in the annotations we
got back for our new version of <i>g.2860</i>.

<p>
