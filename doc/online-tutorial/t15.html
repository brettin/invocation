Many other tools now exist that enable the analysis of genome-scale metabolic models (e.g. 
the cobra toolbox). Most of these tools read models printed in SBML format. We can print
our gapfilled model in SBML format so we can use our model in these tools:

<pre>
  fbamodel_to_sbml < gapfilled.model > gapfilled.model.sbml
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the command completes, do an <i>ls</i> and select the SBML file for download.</p>
