Now we can create an initial annotation for the genome using
<br>
<pre>

  annotate_genome < genome > annotated.genome

</pre>

This causes an initial annotation to be generated.  Note that it may well take a few minutes, and for large genomes
some several minutes.  You can do other commands while you wait, and the completion message will show up
(below the command) when the annotation is complete.  You should try it.  When it completes use the <b>ls</b>
to see the generated file, and click on it to see the encoded annotations.  Alternatively, to the the features
generated and placed in the annotated genome object (stored in <i>annotated.genome</i>, try
<br>
<pre>
  genomeTO_to_feature_data < annotated.genome > features.txt
</br></pre>
which produces a tab-separated table containing 
<br>
<pre>
  [feature-id,location,type,assigned-function]
 <br></pre>
Use <b>ls</b> to see it and explore the contents.
