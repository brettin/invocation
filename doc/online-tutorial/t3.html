Note that you could just upload whatever set of contigs you wanted from a file in your
local machine to your IRIS workarea.  However, in this case we want to get the contigs from the CS.
To do that, we would use

<br>
<pre>
  echo 'kb|g.2860' | genomes_to_contigs | contigs_to_sequences > g.2860.contigs
<br></pre>

Try it and verify that you have easy access to any of the CS genomes.
