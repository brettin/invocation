You will find it convenient to create subdirectories (i.e., folders) to contain
your separate projects.  Otherwise, your IRIS workspace will become pretty cluttered
quickly.  Let's create a subdirectory called <i>g.2860</i> where we will
annotate kb|g.2860 (we encourage you to not use any special characters in your filenames -- it is
asking for trouble; hence, we left of the 'kb|' prefix).

We suggest that you try
<br>
<pre>

  mkdir g.2860
  mv g.2860.contigs g.2860
  cd g.2860
  ls
</br></pre>
The first command creates the subdirectory, the second moves our contigs into the subdirectory,
the third moves our "position" to the subdirectory, and the last display the contents of the subdirectory.
We urge you to verify tht it all works as described.
