Flux balance analysis is a mathematical approach whereby our model is used to simulate
various cellular activities, typical the production of biomass or metabolites from
transportable nutrients. Now that we have a model, let's apply flux balance analysis to
determine if our model can grow, as well as which pathways are utilized during growth:

<pre>
  runfba < initial.model > solution.html
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results from the FBA are printed in HTML in the output solution file. Simply run the
<i>ls</i> command and click on the html file to view the solution. At the top of this file
is a table of the parameters used to run the FBA. Directly below this table, is another 
table showing the objective function and value. In all likely hood, your model did not grow
at all. this is because the model is missing pathways needed for biomass production. When 
a model fails to grow, the FBA command does attempt to diagnose the problem by identifying
biomass components that cannot be produced. This is done by maximizing the production of 
each individual biomass component one at a time. You can see these analysis results in your
solution HTML file (see the metabolite production table). Note, some of your biomass components
have no numbers in this table. These are the components that cannot be produced. Let's try
and fix our model by adding reactions to enable production of these components.
