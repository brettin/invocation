How good are the annotations for your newly-annotated genome?
One way to assess this is to focus on the <i>Roles </i> that might impact metabolic models.
We can look at the ones that were found and then compare them against those that exist in
a similar, manually-curated genome. Let us begin by getting the subset of the Roles that
might impact the metabolic models.  To do that, you might use

<br>
<pre>
  all_roles_used_in_models > all.roles
  a_and_b roles all.roles > roles.for.models
<br></pre>
