We can run a gapfilling command on our model to automatically add reactions as needed to
enable the production of all biomass components:

<pre>
  gapfill_fbamodel < initial.model > gapfilled.model
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the size and state of the genome, this could take minutes to hours, but 
when the analysis is complete, your model will have additional reactions in it, reflecting
the ideal solution identified by the gapfilling algorithm to enable growth. Now we can 
rerun our flux balance analysis to determine the biomass production pathways of our organism.
