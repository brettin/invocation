Suppose that you wished to pursue the goal of annotating a set of closely related
genomes using KBase tools.  Further, suppose that your genomes were from the genus 
<i>Geobacter</i>, and that your goal involved studying the pan-genome and constructing 
metabolic models to clarify differences between strains.  How might you proceed?
