Now that our model has been gapfilled, it should be possible to simulate biomass production
using flux balance analysis. Let's try the <i>runfba</i> command again:

<pre>
  runfba < gapfilled.model > solution.html
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once this command completes, run an <i>ls</i> and click on the html printed by the FBA 
command. Your FBA solution should now include a nonzero objective value as well as numerous 
compound and reaction fluxes.</p>
